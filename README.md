Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge
===========================================================

For this challenge, I have used C#.
I realize that Python is the best language of choice for this kind of assignment and I am a proficient Python programmer. As a result, using Python would have been the easiest choice for me. Instead, I used the hard route for the following reason:

I am currently, finishing my PhD and throughout my thesis, I have used C/C++/Python heavily. I have also worked on Java repositories for my internship work and side projects and hence, I am very comfortable with all the above languages. Recently though, I have been considering an offer from Microsoft for my post-PhD career. Knowing that C# is a language of much favoritisim in Microsoft, I have always wondered to have an opportunity to test my abilities in C#. 

The Insight Data Engineering Challenge happened to be a good start for me. I had no previous experience with C#. As a result, this assignment was my first experience with C#. I believe this could have been a good challenge for me personally to test my learning curve on a new language. It took me half a day to complete the challenge most of which was spent on details of figuring out the correct C# syntax and getting comfortable with coding C# on Visual Studio.
